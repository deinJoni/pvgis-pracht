1 Basics
1.1 Entry points
All the PVGIS tools can be accessed non-interactively using our web APIs. The entry points are:

PVGIS 5.3: https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/api/v5_3/tool_name?param1=value1&param2=value2&...

PVGIS 5.2: https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/api/v5_2/tool_name?param1=value1&param2=value2&...

NB From 25 September 2024 the old entrypoint https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/api/tool_name?param1=value1&param2=value2&...   will serve PVGIS 5.2 for a limited period. Access to PVGIS 5.1 has been removed

The variables are:

tool_name: PVcalc, SHScalc, MRcalc, DRcalc, seriescalc, tmy, printhorizon.
param1=value1, param2=value2, ...: input parameters of the tool with their corresponding values concatenated in a query string format.
 

PVGIS APIs can be called directly using different languages like Python, NodeJS, Perl, Java and many others. Such languages have libraries to ease API calls management. Please, for more information check the documentation of the specific language used.

Warning: access to PVGIS APIs via AJAX is not allowed. Please, do not ask for changes in our CORS policy since these requests will be rejected by the system administrators.

When you report an error, please always specify the exact URL, the parameters used, the exact error text and the exact version of software/libraries you are using and any other information that may help us find and fix the problem.

1.2 HTTP methods allowed
API functions accept GET method only. Other methods will return an HTTP status "405 - Method not allowed". HEAD method has been kept only to confirm the existence of the desired API function, but will return a "204 - No Content" HTTP status to avoid wasting CPU computation time.

1.3 API calls rate limit
API calls have a rate limit of 30 calls/second per IP address. If you exceed this threshold, the service will refuse your call and return a "429 - Too Many Requests" HTTP status.

1.4 Simultaneous computations tasks limit
To avoid server slowdowns due to too many simultaneous computations tasks, we introduced a new mechanism to handle excessive requests that affect the service availability.

All the exceeding computation requests that are outside the optimal computation frame, will be suspended for 150/200 milliseconds before a new try, waiting for just released resource. The number of tries are limited to a cap of 4/5 seconds, and after that limit the service will return a "529 - Site is overloaded" HTTP status code.

This status code is used to tell you that you should repeat the request after a while.

1.5 Inputs
If any of the inputs is out of the expected range, a json error message will be returned specifying the range of expected values for that input.
The query string must include at least all the mandatory inputs of the app (see minimal usage examples). The default values will be used for undefined optional parameters.
Inputs not required by the tool will be deprecated.
1.6 Outputs
The outputs obtained with the non-interactive service are exactly the same as those obtained with the PVGIS interface. The output type is controlled with the following two parameters:

outputformat:
outputformat=csv CSV output.
outputformat=json JSON output.
outputformat=basic Raw CSV output without metadata.
outputformat=epw Energy Plus EPW file (only for the TMY tool).
browser:
browser=0 Output as a stream.
browser=1 Output as a file.
We encourage users to use the JSON output for integrating PVGIS results in other web services and scripts. This will reduce potential impacts of future PVGIS upgrades in their services.

Example of the minimum usage:

https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/api/PVcalc?lat=45&lon=8&peakpower=1&loss=14

For the fixed PV system, if the parameter "optimalinclination" is selected (set to 1), the value defined for the "angle" parameter is ignored. Similarly, if "optimalangles" is set to 1, values defined for "angle" and "aspect" are ignored and therefore are not necessary. In this case, parameter "optimalinclination" would not be necessary either.
For the inclined axis PV system analysis, the parameter "inclined_axis" must be selected, along with either "inclinedaxisangle" or "inclined_optimum". If parameter "inclined_optimum" is selected, the inclination angle defined in "inclinedaxisangle" is ignored, so this parameter would not be necessary.
Parameters regarding the vertical axis ("vertical_axis", "vertical_optimum" and "verticalaxisangle") are related in the same way as the parameters used for the inclined axis PV system.

There is also the option to supply user-defined horizon information. This would not normally be useful since the web service will just send the horizon information back to you. However, it can be a way to check that PVGIS interprets the user-supplied horizon information correctly
